## RISCV_UET  
This is a simple RISC-V 3-stage pipeline processor based on riscv mini from UCB and currently implements RV32I ISA based on User-level ISA Version 2.0 and the Machine-level ISA using Privileged Architecture Version 1.7. (Update for both is required) 
 
Current Implementation:

- 3 stage pipelined processor
- No structural hazards
- Data hazards are resolved using forward and stall
- No branch prediction
- Simple instruction and data memory integration for testing

### Generating Verilog
Different components for the processor core are integrated in sbt `'src/main/scala/ProcessorTile.scala'`. The verilog code can be generated by executing the following command:

`> sbt run`
 
and choosing 

`riscv_uet.Core_Main`.
